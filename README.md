# AI Company Case Study - Fable Studio
## Overview and Origin

* **Name of company:** Fable Studio

* **When was the company incorporated?** 2017

* **Who are the founders of the company?** Edward Saatchi and Pete Billington

* **How did the idea for the company come about?** Fable Studio was born from the Facebook VR movie studio "Story Studio" out of Oculus. VR movie adoption was slow, so Edward Saatchi and Pete Billington created Fable Studio to focus more on creating AI virtual beings for people to interact with instead of making long-form produced content - their VR experience "Wolves in the Walls" won an Emmy and included a virtual being named Lucy that interacts with the audience.

* **How is the company funded?** Fable has received four funding rounds since 2017 from numerous investors including 7percent Ventures, Boston Seed Capital, LionTree Partners, Riverside Ventures, and others 

## Business Activities

* **What specific problem is the company trying to solve?** Fable Studio has the ambitious goal to create AGI virtual intelligence for people to interact with, similiar to a very advanced version of The Sims. Fable Studio is working on launching *The Simulation*, which is a way for users to interact with virtual beings in the form of video games - this helps encourage people to participate while helping the virtual beings learn via complex models.

* **Who is the company's intended customer?** Fable Studio is trying to capture an audience that is interested in interacting with virtual beings through various forms of media - your virtual being will eventually talk to you across your computer, TV, movies, VR headsets, phone, tablet etc. You are present while your virtual being wakes up for the first time, and you are supposed to teach right & wrong throughout its life. The company compares the idea to how children have imaginary friends - you, the user, are in theory the virtual being's imaginary friend; they cannot see you, but they talk to you and believe that you exist. For this reason, Fable Studio's intended customer is anyone that has access to the infrastructure necessary to connect online and is interested in developing a relationship with a potential AGI being.

* **What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not?** Fable does not necessarily have a solution today that their competitors lack. Fable's concept of *The Simulation* is more an idea to be the first company ever to create AGI, not by building the technology in a silo but by opening it up to the world via online games. The more people that interact with the virtual beings in *The Simulation*, the more the ML models can learn. The key for Fable is whether people will select their platform as the one to use for virtual interactions vs competitors - one potential advantage for Fable Studio here is the possibility they may still have access to some resources from their relationship with Facebook, given Facebook's mass influence around the globe.

* **Which technologies are they currently using?** Fable studio leverages LLMs/natural language processing, ML, animation tools, VR, and prompt learning.

## Results

* **What has been the business impact of this company so far?** Fable Studio's primary ambition on creating AGI via virtual beings is still in its concept phase, so this side of the business has not had an impact yet. Fable Studio did separately create SHOW-1, however, a film & TV showrunnner tool that claimed to be able to create entire South Park episodes via a few simple prompts by leveraging Chat GPT and Stable Diffusion. Fable has stated they released the tool during the Hollywood writer's guild and SAG strikes to warn creatives how AI can now create content for anyone, almost instantly - a big risk to Hollywood creatives. The news of this tool had a massive impact on Hollywood as AI then became a central negotiating point in the guild negotations with the studios, whereas previously it was more of an afterthought. There is still some speculation as to whether the tool can really create entire South Park episodes instantly.

## Recommendations

* **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?** I would recommend Fable implement cross service integration with its virtual beings immediately at launch, e.g. have the virtual beings available on phones, TVs, computers etc.

* **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?** It will be difficult for Fable Studio to retain users in *The Simulation* over a long period of time; people have short attention spans, often getting bored with certain games and moving on. If you want people to truly care about their virtual beings and keep using the service, the virtual beings need to be readily available across certain apps on phones, TVs, video games etc immediately. This would ensure people are thinking about their virtual beings more often, as they are often more accessible and can be integrated more in each user's day.

* **Why are the technologies with your recommendation appropriate for your solution?** To have the virtual beings available across various platforms at launch will take more time, but keep people more engaged. Reaching true AGI is something that will take time. If you could have your virtual being watching a TV show with you or on your phone to check in at launch though, it will be on more people's minds as they go through their day. It is more complex and requires more resources to build, but in the end encourages more usage - and the entire purpose of Fable Studio building *The Simulation* is to reach AGI, and the only way to do that is with significant & consistent usage.
